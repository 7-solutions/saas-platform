## Test Execution

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all integration tests
pnpm test:integration

# Run specific test suites
pnpm test:integration:api      # API endpoint tests
pnpm test:integration:load     # Load testing
pnpm test:integration:security # Security validation
pnpm test:e2e                  # End-to-end tests
```

### Individual Test Commands
```bash
# API testing
pnpm test:api

# Load testing
pnpm test:load

# Security testing
pnpm test:security

# Container testing
pnpm test:containers

# Responsive design testing
pnpm test:integration:responsive
```

### Comprehensive Test Runner
The main test runner script (`scripts/run-integration-tests.sh`) provides:
- **Dependency Checking**: Validates all required tools
- **Environment Setup**: Starts services and waits for readiness
- **Sequential Test Execution**: Runs all test suites in order
- **Cleanup**: Proper environment teardown
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed test reports

## Test Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=test
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
CMS_URL=http://localhost:3001
