# Docker Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The Docker build was failing with the following error:
```
go: github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest: version constraints conflict:
	github.com/cosmtrek/air@v1.62.0: parsing go.mod:
	module declares its path as: github.com/air-verse/air
	but was required as: github.com/cosmtrek/air
```

## Root Cause
The Air package (used for Go hot reloading in development) has moved from `github.com/cosmtrek/air` to `github.com/air-verse/air`. The old repository path was causing the build to fail.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Air Package Reference
**File**: `backend/Dockerfile.dev`
```dockerfile
# Before
RUN go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest

# After  
RUN go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```

### 2. Removed Obsolete Docker Compose Version
**Files**: `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`
```yaml
# Before
version: '3.8'
services:
  ...

# After
services:
  ...
```

## Verification

### 1. Docker Build Test
```bash
docker build -f backend/Dockerfile.dev -t saas-backend-dev backend/
```
✅ **Result**: Build completed successfully

### 2. Docker Compose Validation
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config --quiet
```
✅ **Result**: Configuration is valid with no warnings

## Impact

- ✅ Development Docker builds now work correctly
- ✅ Hot reloading with Air will function properly
- ✅ Docker Compose configurations are clean and warning-free
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. `backend/Dockerfile.dev` - Updated Air package reference
2. `docker-compose.yml` - Removed obsolete version attribute
3. `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Removed obsolete version attribute

## Next Steps

The Docker build issue is now resolved. Developers can:

1. **Start development environment**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. **Build individual services**:
   ```bash
   docker build -f backend/Dockerfile.dev -t saas-backend-dev backend/
   ```

3. **Run integration tests**:
   ```bash
   pnpm test:integration:container
   ```

All Docker-related functionality should now work correctly without build errors.
