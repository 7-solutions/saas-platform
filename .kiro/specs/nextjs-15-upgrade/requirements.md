### Requirement 3: Docker Container Optimization

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want optimized Docker containers that start reliably and build efficiently, so that development and deployment processes are fast and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are built THEN they SHALL use multi-stage builds for optimal layer caching
2. WHEN containers start THEN all services SHALL be available within 30 seconds
3. WHEN rebuilding containers THEN build time SHALL be reduced by at least 30% from current baseline
4. WHEN containers run THEN they SHALL use non-root users for security
5. WHEN containers are built THEN final image sizes SHALL be reduced by at least 40%
6. WHEN development containers start THEN Next.js development server SHALL be accessible
7. WHEN production containers start THEN they SHALL serve the built application correctly

### Requirement 4: Package Manager Modernization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the latest pnpm version with optimized workspace configuration, so that dependency management is faster and more reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package manager is updated THEN pnpm SHALL use version 9.15.0 or higher
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN workspace resolution SHALL work without conflicts
3. WHEN running pnpm commands THEN they SHALL execute 20% faster than current baseline
4. WHEN building packages THEN workspace dependencies SHALL resolve correctly
5. WHEN using turbo commands THEN they SHALL work with the updated pnpm version
6. WHEN installing new packages THEN lockfile SHALL remain consistent across environments

### Requirement 5: Build Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want faster build times and improved development experience, so that I can iterate quickly and deploy efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN total build time SHALL be under 2 minutes
2. WHEN using hot reload in development THEN changes SHALL reflect within 500ms
3. WHEN running type checking THEN it SHALL complete within 30 seconds
4. WHEN using Turbo caching THEN subsequent builds SHALL be at least 50% faster
5. WHEN building in parallel THEN multiple apps SHALL build concurrently
6. WHEN using development mode THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 2GB per container

### Requirement 6: Security and Dependency Updates

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions, so that the application is protected against known vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN all packages SHALL use versions without known high/critical vulnerabilities

3. WHEN caching is configured THEN it SHALL use Next.js 15 enhanced caching strategies
4. WHEN TypeScript config is updated THEN it SHALL support all Next.js 15 features
5. WHEN using experimental features THEN they SHALL be stable and production-ready
6. WHEN building for production THEN output SHALL use standalone mode for optimal Docker deployment

### Requirement 8: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the upgrade doesn't break existing functionality, so that users experience no regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upgrade is complete THEN all existing unit tests SHALL pass
