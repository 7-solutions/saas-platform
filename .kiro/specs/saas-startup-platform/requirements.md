# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive SaaS & Tech Startup platform consisting of a public-facing website and content management system (CMS). The platform will be built as a monorepo using modern TypeScript frameworks for the frontend, Go with gRPC for the backend API, and CouchDB for data persistence. The entire development environment will be containerized using Docker for consistent development and deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Public Website Frontend

**User Story:** As a potential customer, I want to visit a professional startup website, so that I can learn about the company's services and products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display a responsive homepage with company branding
2. WHEN a user navigates the site THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and modern UI components using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
3. WHEN a user views the site on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a fully responsive design
4. WHEN a user interacts with the site THEN the system SHALL provide fast loading times and optimal performance
5. IF a user wants to contact the company THEN the system SHALL provide contact forms and information

### Requirement 2: Content Management System (CMS)

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want to manage website content through an intuitive CMS, so that I can update pages, blog posts, and site information without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator logs into the CMS THEN the system SHALL provide a secure authentication mechanism
2. WHEN an administrator creates content THEN the system SHALL provide a rich text editor with media upload capabilities
3. WHEN an administrator publishes content THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes on the public website
4. WHEN an administrator manages pages THEN the system SHALL provide CRUD operations for all content types
5. IF an administrator uploads media THEN the system SHALL handle image optimization and storage

### Requirement 3: RESTful API with gRPC Backend

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want to access platform data through well-defined APIs, so that I can integrate with external services and provide data to frontend applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the Go backend SHALL expose both gRPC and REST endpoints via gRPC Gateway
2. WHEN a client makes API requests THEN the system SHALL authenticate and authorize requests appropriately
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted JSON responses
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes
5. IF high traffic occurs THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently

### Requirement 4: CouchDB Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data storage and retrieval, so that all platform data is persisted securely and can be queried efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is created or updated THEN the system SHALL persist changes to CouchDB
2. WHEN queries are executed THEN the system SHALL return results efficiently using CouchDB views and indexes
3. WHEN the system starts THEN the database SHALL be properly initialized with required schemas
4. IF data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL handle CouchDB's conflict resolution appropriately
5. WHEN backups are needed THEN the system SHALL support CouchDB replication and backup strategies

### Requirement 5: Monorepo Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all related code in a single repository, so that I can manage dependencies, share code, and maintain consistency across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is cloned THEN the system SHALL contain all frontend, backend, and configuration code
2. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate package managers for each technology stack
3. WHEN code is shared between projects THEN the system SHALL provide shared libraries and utilities
4. IF builds are triggered THEN the system SHALL support building individual components or the entire platform
5. WHEN development occurs THEN the system SHALL provide consistent tooling and scripts across all projects

### Requirement 6: Containerized Development with Docker

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the entire platform locally using containers, so that I can develop in an environment that matches production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development environment starts THEN Docker SHALL orchestrate all required services
2. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL provide hot reloading for frontend development
3. WHEN the database is needed THEN Docker SHALL start and configure CouchDB with proper networking
4. IF services need to communicate THEN Docker SHALL provide proper container networking
5. WHEN development is complete THEN the system SHALL support easy teardown and cleanup of containers

### Requirement 7: TypeScript Frontend Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to use modern TypeScript frameworks with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, so that I can build maintainable and visually appealing user interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend builds THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript without errors
2. WHEN UI components are needed THEN the system SHALL provide shadcn/ui components with Tailwind styling
3. WHEN styles are applied THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for consistent design
4. IF type safety is required THEN the system SHALL enforce TypeScript strict mode
5. WHEN the frontend connects to APIs THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe API client integration

### Requirement 8: Development and Build Tooling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive development tooling, so that I can efficiently build, test, and deploy the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run linting and formatting checks
2. WHEN builds are triggered THEN the system SHALL provide fast incremental builds
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL execute unit and integration tests
4. IF code quality checks are needed THEN the system SHALL provide static analysis tools
5. WHEN deployment is required THEN the system SHALL provide containerized deployment artifacts
